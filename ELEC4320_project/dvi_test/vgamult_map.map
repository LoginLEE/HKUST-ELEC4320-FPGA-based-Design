Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   100 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          290
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           147 out of     290   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   7 out of     290    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         136 out of     290   46%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              10
    Total Memory used (KB):                    936 out of   5,328   17%
