    Number used as Flip Flops:                 119
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        122 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                      121 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             109
      Number using O5 output only:               7
      Number using O5 and O6:                    5
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                         8
    Number using O6 output only:                 8

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    37 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          130
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            11 out of     130    8%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   8 out of     130    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         111 out of     130   85%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               9 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              33
    Total Memory used (KB):                    594 out of   5,328   11%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
